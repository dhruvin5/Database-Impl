Step 1) navigate to the path of this folder app/src/main/java/query_executer

Step 2) Give execution permissions all these scripts in terminal:
        2.1) chmod +x preprocess
        2.2) chmod +x run_query
        2.3) chmod +x Load_psql
        2.4) chmod +x run_correctness_test

Step 3) Run preprocess script to prepare all base Table binary files(Movies,Work,People) for lab3 code in terminal, UPDATE BASE FILE PATHS AS NEEDED:
        ./preprocess

Step 4) After prepocessing was successful, you will see the bin files created in the dir
        and will see this in terminal output:
        "Preprocessing Completed Successfully! "

Step 5) Update the Query output file name in runquery.java before executing your query, and save the JAVA file

Step 6) To run the query, invoke the runquery script in this format in Terminal (update start range end range and buffer size):
        ./run_query 'Alaa' 'Alab' 6

Step 7) Perform Correctness Test:
        7.1) Load data in postgres:
             7.1.1) Perform base file cleanup using this command in terminal- NOTE: update paths for imdb files and cleaned files in base_file_cleaner.java:
             ./run_base_file_cleanup
             7.2.2) load data in postgres by running this command in terminal- NOTE: update cleaned file paths and output result file path(USE RELATIVE PATH HERE) as needed and USE SAME RANGE:
             ./Load_psql 'Alaa' 'Alab'
             This will connect to psql, populate the schemas and write query result from psql to csv file
        
        7.2) Comparing results
             7.2) Paste the following command in terminal to perform correctness test. NOTE: update paths of files in CT.java (USE RELATIVE PATHS FOR BOTH FILES):
             ./run_correctness_test
