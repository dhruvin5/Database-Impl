Step 1) navigate to the path of this folder app/src/main/java/query_executer
Step 2) Give execution permissions to both preprocess and run_query scripts in terminal:
        2.1) chmod +x preprocess
        2.2) chmod +x run_query
Step 3) Run preprocess script to prepare all base Table binary files(Movies,Work,People) in terminal:
        ./preprocess
Step 4) After prepocessing was successful, you will see the bin files created in the dir
        and will see this in terminal output:
        "Preprocessing Completed Successfully! "

Step 5) Update the Query output file name/path in runquery.java before executing your query, and save the file
Step 6) To run the query, invoke the runquery script in this format in Terminal (update start range end range and buffer size):
        ./run_query 'Caa' 'Cab' 1000

Step 7) To compare the output files from LAB3 Code and postgres for the selected range:
        7.1) Update paths for both files in CT.java file and save it.
        7.2) Paste the following command in terminal and run it (update path if needed):
        javac app/src/main/java/CT.java
        java -cp app/src/main/java CT
